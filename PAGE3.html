				<h3>Profile</h3>
				<P>In our profile, we show our achievements including grades, gold coins, and sports information. The sports information details the mileage values you have traveled, the time spent and the number of calories burned.</P>
                <P>The most important part is the bottom part, which records the route you have traveled. You can refresh these routes repeatedly to accumulate more coins.</P>

				<h3>Friend chat</h3>
				<P>The main advantage of hiking is that you can walk alone or with friends, and you can meet new friends with similar interests. In this section, you can talk privately with your friends or form a group to exchange experiences and share achievements.
