				<p>Here are some low-level routes, and users can choose to go hiking. These primary routes can be completed in an hour to three hours. Adopting such a path to relax when the user is busy is the best choice.</p>

				<h3>Locked Discover</h3>
				<p>These locked locations are high-level routes that can be unlocked when you complete the previous low-level course. These routes will gradually increase the difficulty, and the level will increase progressively, including time and distance, which requires sufficient experience to complete.</p>

				<h3>Map</h3>
				<P>We all know that there are almost no signals on mobile phones in the mountains, so it is difficult to see where you are. We can download these maps before departure so that it will be more convenient to use.</P>
                <P>There are thumbnails of some maps at the top of this page, so you can more easily choose where you want to go. The middle part is a large map with some symbols on it, and you can find the exact location of these places. Some of them will set up QR code scanning. When you have finished scanning, you can win the corresponding points, and you can exchange what you need in the support station.</P>
